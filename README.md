### Welcome to my Vacation Finder App!
#### All you have to do is answer 10 simple questions and we will match you with the location of your next holiday destination. 

When you first visit the webpage, you are prompted to start the Survey. See screenshot below.

Once you click on the _Start Survey Button_ you will begin the survey. The screenshot below displays the survey page. One of the first things the user sees is a Bootstrap carousel of a few potential destinations. Scroll down to the survey and answer all 10 questions. See screenshot below of the survey page.

Once the survey has been submitted, a Bootstrap Modal will apear with the results. A location has been matched with you based on your responses to the 10 questions. Each destination has values (1-5) associated with each question. User response values are then compared with each destination and the destination with the lowest absolute difference will be selected. See screenshot below of potential results.
